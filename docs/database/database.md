# Database
{: .no_toc}
We are sharing a variety of data from behaving rats and mice. Combined more than 70.000 cells that are available to explore or use as reference data for classifying your own data. CellExplorer achieves this by communicate with the [Buzsaki lab databank](https://buzsakilab.com/wp/database/). The public data in the databank can be downloaded and loaded as reference data without login credentials. Credentials are necessary for having full access and writing capabilities.
* [Setup full access](/database/preparation/).

# Public data
Any sessions located in the repository **NYUshare_Datasets** is publicly available and can be downloaded and loaded automatically in CellExplorer, without providing any database credentials. Upon request the data will be downloaded from our [public web share](https://buzsakilab.nyumc.org/datasets/) and saved to the local CellExplorer directory `referenceData/` for future access. Be patient when downloading the data as some sessions are very large (spanning a few to hundreds of MB).
