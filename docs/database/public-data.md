# Public data
We are sharing a large set of cells that is available to explore or use as reference data for classifying your own data. Any sessions located in the repository **NYUshare_Datasets** is publicly available and can be downloaded and loaded automatically in CellExplorer, without providing any database credentials. Upon request the data will be downloaded from our [public web share](https://buzsakilab.nyumc.org/datasets/) and saved to the local CellExplorer directory `referenceData/` for future access. Be patient when downloading the data as some sessions are very large.
